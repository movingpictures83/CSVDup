Take a CSV file and output all duplicate row and column headers, along with their counts.

These headers and counts will be stored in tabular format in an NOA file containing two columns.
One file will be produced for duplicate rows, the other for duplicate columns, using the output prefix:
prefix.row.noa
prefix.col.noa
